### About

This flame seems to be fueled by magic itself. The number of uses for an ever-burning flame seems endless, but unfortunately it seems to produce much more light than heat.

### Recipe

Nitor is created in the Crafting Table with:

- 1 Fire Charge
- 1 Dye
- 1 Blaze Powder

Depending on what dye you use in crafting, this color will be the nitor.

### Uses

Nitor can be used to illuminate areas very similar to torches, but will look fairly similar to an aura.
